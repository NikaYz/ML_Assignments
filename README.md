# ML Assignments

This repository contains assignments completed as part of the **Machine Learning Course** (Course Code: T1-24-25-AIM 511-Machine Learning) at IMT.

## Contents

- **Assignment 1**: Regularized Regression Model
  - **Description**: This assignment involves training and testing a regularized regression model (e.g.,Linear Regression, Ridge or Lasso regression) to predict a target label based on given features. Regularization techniques are used to prevent overfitting and improve the modelâ€™s generalization performance.
  - **Goal**: To understand and apply L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques to regression problems.

- **Assignment 2**: Decision Tree Model on Titanic Dataset
  - **Description**: This assignment applies a Decision Tree model (Random Forest, XGBoost or AdaBoost) to the Titanic dataset. The objective is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, etc.
  - **Goal**: To explore tree-based classification methods and evaluate model performance on real-world data.

- **Assignment 3**: Clustering News Headlines
  - **Description**: This assignment applies clustering techniques to a dataset of 19,685 news headlines. The goal is to uncover patterns in the headlines using K-Means Clustering and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering. The dataset has been preprocessed and transformed into a 1,000-dimensional TF-IDF feature matrix. The task also involves comparing the clustering results.
  - **Goal**: To apply clustering algorithms to uncover themes in news headlines.
